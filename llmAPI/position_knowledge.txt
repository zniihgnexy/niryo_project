the main view is the position of the robot in the chess board

the first rwo the is the closest to the robot is row A
the first column that is on the right side of the robot is column 1

For right and left relative position.
the left square of position A1 would be A2, and left of A2 would be A3 and so on
the right square of position B2 would be B1 and right of B3 would be B2 and so on
number 1 is the right corner position of the line and number 8 is the left corner position of the line

For forward and backward relative position,
the forward square of position A1 would be B1 and forward of position B2 would be C2 and so on
the backward square of position B2 would be A2 and backward of position C3 would be B3 and so on

so the top line of the chess board is row C and the bottom line is row A
